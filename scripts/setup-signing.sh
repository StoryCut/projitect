# setup-signing.sh
#
# Ensures every commit in this repo is signed with the dedicated "Claude Code"
# SSH key, so commits land with the green "Verified" badge on GitHub. Idempotent.
#
# When this runs:
#   - Automatically: the `SessionStart` hook in .claude/settings.json fires this
#     on every agent session start. That's the "never forget" guarantee — signing
#     is configured before the first commit of the session, without anyone having
#     to remember.
#   - Manually: run `bash scripts/setup-signing.sh` if signing ever stops working
#     (e.g. after a fresh clone, which doesn't carry repo-local git config).
#
# How this differs from StoryCut:
#   StoryCut rewrites the *author identity* to "Claude Code (<contributor>)" via
#   per-worktree config, gated on `claude/*` / `agent/*` branches. projitect keeps
#   the contributor's normal authorship and configures *signing only*, repo-local,
#   on every branch. The goal here is the Verified badge on every commit, not a
#   separate author identity. (If we ever want Claude-authored commits, switch to
#   StoryCut's worktree-gated approach — see AGENTS.md › Commit signing.)
#
# Where the key comes from:
#   The signing key + allowed-signers file are read from ~/.gitconfig.claude (the
#   per-machine agent identity file, shared with StoryCut). If that file is absent,
#   we fall back to the conventional paths. If no key is found at all, we print a
#   one-line hint and exit 0 — never blocking a session or a CI install.
