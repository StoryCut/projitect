/**
 * @projitect/blueprint-vitest
 *
 * One composite blueprint that wires vitest into a project:
 *
 *  1. Adds `vitest` and (optionally) `@vitest/coverage-v8` to `package.json`'s `devDependencies`,
 *     plus `test` / `test:watch` scripts. Merge mode — non-conflicting with whatever else lives
 *     in `package.json`.
 *  2. Owns `vitest.config.ts` with sensible defaults (NodeNext-friendly, v8 coverage). Owned
 *     mode — projitect rewrites this file from scratch on every `remodel` so the user can't
 *     accidentally drift it. If the user wants project-specific overrides, they should compose
 *     this blueprint with their own `ownFile` blueprint at a different path.
 *  3. Adds `coverage/` to `.gitignore`. Region mode — coexists with whatever else is in the file
 *     (including other projitect blueprints like `@projitect/blueprint-gitignore`).
 *
 * This is the smallest framework blueprint we ship after gitignore. It validates merge mode +
 * owned mode + region mode in one move, and it's the first time the projitect blueprint won't
 * be the *only* merge-mode consumer in a real project.
