/**
 * The sandboxed file system blueprints receive. The real `@effect/platform` `FileSystem` is
 * never provided to blueprint code — `cli-internals` wires a permission-gated implementation
 * here.
 *
 * The interface lives in `@projitect/core` so it can be referenced from both `@projitect/blueprint`
 * (which exposes helpers built on it) and `@projitect/cli-internals` (which implements it).
 *
 * The current implementation is a soft sandbox: it enforces permissions at the Effect layer but
 * runs in the same process as the CLI. A worker-process implementation is a tracked v2 follow-up;
 * the interface is shaped so the swap is transparent to blueprint authors.
