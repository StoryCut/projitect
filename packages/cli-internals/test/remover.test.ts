/**
 * Tests for `remover.ts` — the path that fires when a blueprint *leaves* `.pjt.ts` and its
 * previously-applied operations need to be unwound from disk. This is what makes "swap frameworks
 * cleanly" actually deliver: removing a blueprint must also delete the stuff it added.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *  - region removal preserves surrounding content (and the marker pair gets deleted, not just the
 *    body)
 *  - merge removal deep-deletes dotted keys and prunes now-empty parent objects so the file
 *    doesn't bloat with `"scripts": {}`
 *  - owned removal deletes the file
 *  - seed removal is a no-op (write-once; we never delete what the user might have edited)
 *  - missing files / missing regions are silently skipped (the file may have been hand-deleted)
 *  - touched-paths return value lists exactly the paths actually mutated
