/**
 * The projitect blueprint. Automatically prepended to every user's blueprint tree by the `pjt()`
 * function exported from `projitect/cli`. Owns everything projitect itself needs to stay coherent
 * in the host project:
 *
 *   - `package.json` keys: `scripts.pjt`, `devDependencies.projitect`, `devDependencies.effect`
 *     (merge mode — coexists with other tools touching package.json)
 *   - `.pjt.ts` region `pjt:projitect:imports`, containing the `import { pjt } from "projitect/cli"`
 *     line (region mode — `pjt inspect` catches hand-edits that break the import)
 *
 * There's nothing special about this blueprint downstream of `pjt()`: it flows through the
 * standard planner, applier, lockfile pipeline like any other blueprint. The only "magic" is the
 * one-line prepend in `projitect/cli`.
 *
 * The marker pairs `pjt:imports` and `pjt:blueprints` that `pjt add` splices into are **not**
 * managed regions — just conventions. If a user removes them, `pjt add` fails clearly with
 * `pjt.add.markers-missing` rather than overwriting their hand-edited file.
